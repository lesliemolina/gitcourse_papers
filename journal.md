# Introduction
We present here aircraft measurements of SOA over Niger, using an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer ( Allan, 2004).
Joe Bloggs has already made some awesome measurements, but hasn't answered all the science yet. 
Jim HAywood (2000) made aircraft measurements over the Sahel, focussing on radioactive forcings.

# Simulations
John ran his atmospheric model to simulate SOA formation. 

# Methodology
Measurements were made using an AMS, as described in Allan et al 2003. 


# Results
These simulations have proven the utility of the model comparison. 


# Conclusions
Here we conclude that the model is valid
